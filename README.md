# Unofficial-UChicago-Beamer-Theme
Files to theme your LaTeX Beamer presentation to match the University of Chicago colors.

Note that this theme is unofficial. It is in no way endorsed by the University of Chicago.

The screenshots below give an idea of what the main elements of the presentation look like. For more information on how the entire theme looks, see the [compiled example presentation (.pdf)]("https://github.com/michaelkirker/Unofficial-UChicago-Beamer-Theme/blob/master/Unofficial_UChicago_Theme_Example.pdf") within the repository.

This theme is an ongoing side-project, and there are (probably) many Beamer commands that either don't quite look nice or simply don't work well with this theme. Please feel free to report any bugs or improvements you would like to see. Otherwise updates to the theme will generally occur each time I put together a new presentation and encounter some new element in the presentation would could look better.

## How to use the theme ##

If you do not use Git, you can download the the necessary files as a zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/michaelkirker/Unofficial-UChicago-Beamer-Theme/archive/master.zip "here").


Add the folder */graphics/* and the file *beamerthemeUnofficialUChicago.sty* to the folder containing the .tex file for your beamer presentation.

Alternatively, add the graphics folder and .sty file to the TeX search path so that all your Beamer presentations can call the files from one location. 


The following code illustrates how to call the theme inside your .tex file.

    \documentclass[12pt]{beamer}
    
    \usetheme{UnofficialUChicago}
    
    \begin{document}
    
    \maketitle % It is important to use the command "\maketitle" to generate your title slide. "\titlepage" does not automatically generate the background image.
    
    % The rest of your Beamer presentation goes here
    
    \end{document}


This Beamer theme also works in the wide screen (16:9) aspect ratio. To create wide screen slides (rather than the default 4:3 ratio), add `,aspectratio=169` into the options for \documentclass (the first line in the example above).
